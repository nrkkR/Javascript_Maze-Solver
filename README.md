# Maze Solver

## Description
Maze Solver is a tool to generate random mazes and solve them using algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). This software provides a visual representation of the maze generation and solution process.

## Features
- **Generate Maze**: Create a new random maze with start and end points.
- **Solve Maze with DFS**: Solve the maze using Depth-First Search algorithm.
- **Solve Maze with BFS**: Solve the maze using Breadth-First Search algorithm.
- **Clear Maze**: Reset the maze.

## Installation
To run the Maze Solver locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nrkkR/maze-solver.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd maze-solver
    ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser**
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```
    or simply double-click `index.html`.

## Usage
Upon opening the application, you will be greeted with the main interface where you can:

1. **Generate Maze**: Click the "Generate Maze" button to create a new random maze.
2. **Solve Maze**: Click "Solve with DFS" or "Solve with BFS" to visualize the solution path.
3. **Clear Maze**: Click the "Clear" button to reset the maze.
